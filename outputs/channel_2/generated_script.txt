Let’s talk about veganism’s awkward collision with cinema. Film critic Allison McCulloch is dissecting movies through a vegan lens, flagging everything from leather jackets to steak dinners in her reviews. She gave Kraven the Hunter a vegan point for sparing a lion but docked it for characters eating steak, calling it a contradiction in the antihero’s “compassion.” I find this fascinating—not just as activism, but as a mirror to how casually we normalize animal exploitation. When McCulloch says a glass of milk onscreen is “full of violence,” she’s reframing mundane details as ethical landmines. But here’s my take: does this hyper-vigilance risk turning art into a checklist? If every omelet in a rom-com becomes a moral failing, does it alienate more than it educates? It’s like reverse product placement—instead of selling Coke, you’re shaming butter. I respect the rigor, but wonder if it’s preaching to an avocado choir. Still, her 24,000 reviews prove there’s an audience hungry for media that aligns with their values. Stay tuned, give this video a like, and consider subscribing.
