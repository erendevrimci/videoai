00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Allison McCulloch's vegan film critiques hit like a sledgehammer to Hollywood's casual animal exploitation.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,500
Her vegan alerts on Letterboxd dissect everything from fur coats to background steak dinners,

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,500
forcing viewers to confront the invisible violence in mundane details.

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:24,500
I think her approach is fascinating, not just as activism but as a new lens for media literacy.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
When she calls out Craven the hunter's dissonance, saving lions while eating steak,

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,500
it exposes how thoughtlessly scripts normalize animal consumption.

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,000
Her system reminds me of peeling an onion.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,500
Each layer reveals hidden ethical contradictions.

9
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,500
Take Nosferatu getting docked for horse carriages and vampire symbolism.

10
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:49,500
It's not about literal harm, but the cultural baggage of animal subjugation.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,500
McCulloch's reviews aren't just warnings.

12
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:58,000
They're blueprints for reimagining storytelling without defaulting to exploitation.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But here's my hot take.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,500
This isn't about policing art.

15
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,000
It's about accountability.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
If a character's leather jacket or omelet breakfast isn't essential to the plot, why include it?

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,500
McCulloch's work pressures creators to ask that question, and maybe swap cliches for conscious choices.

18
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:22,500
Still, I wonder, does this hyper-awareness risk reducing films to checklists?

19
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,000
Either way, she's shifting the conversation.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,500
