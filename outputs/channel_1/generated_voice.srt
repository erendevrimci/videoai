00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's talk about how a dessert named after a 13th-century murderer

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,480
became the ultimate Ramadan comfort food.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,600
Om Ali, Egypt's beloved bread pudding, is a paradox.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:17,760
Creamy, crunchy, and caramelized, it's a staple at Iftar tables,

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,639
yet its origin story reads like a medieval thriller.

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,799
Legend claims it was created to celebrate the murder of a rival queen,

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,120
beaten to death with wooden clogs.

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,880
Food historian Dr. Menat Ala El-Dory admits there's no concrete evidence

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,320
linking the dessert to the crime,

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,119
but Egyptians embrace the narrative as a metaphor for justice prevailing.

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,119
Nermayn Mansour, a food blogger, calls it

12
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:47,119
a warm hug in a clay pot, blending nutrition with nostalgia.

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,439
I'm fascinated by how food carries layered histories,

14
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,240
sometimes sweet, sometimes sinister.

15
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:01,119
Om Ali's enduring popularity isn't just about taste, it's about cultural memory.

16
00:01:01,919 --> 00:01:04,959
The dish transforms leftover bread into something decadent,

17
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,320
mirroring how societies repurpose trauma into triumph.

18
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,120
Yet I can't ignore the irony,

19
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,120
a dessert symbolizing unity and celebration rooted in violence.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,879
It's a reminder that traditions often hide messy truths.

21
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:22,239
During Ramadan, Om Ali's simplicity shines.

22
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,239
Milk, pastry, nuts, a quick glucose boost after fasting.

23
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,239
But its legacy? A culinary time capsule.

24
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:34,879
