The ripple effects of Trump’s latest China tariffs are hitting US tech firms like a sledgehammer. Deena Ghazarian, founder of Austere, told the BBC her audio accessory business nearly collapsed under 25% import taxes in 2019—and now faces déjà vu. "I literally thought I’d start and end a company in a year," she says. Apple suppliers and retailers like Best Buy warn prices could spike 10%, with CEO Corie Barry admitting tariffs will "probably be passed to consumers." My take? This isn’t protectionism—it’s economic chaos. Forcing US companies to eat costs or reshore overnight ignores the tangled reality of global supply chains. China still makes 78% of US smartphones and 79% of laptops. You can’t dismantle that dependency with tariffs alone—you’ll just get inflation and half-empty shelves.
